This repository demonstrates a common C++ error: dereferencing a null pointer. The `bug.cpp` file contains the erroneous code, which attempts to write to memory pointed to by a null pointer. This results in undefined behavior, typically a segmentation fault. The `bugSolution.cpp` file provides the corrected code, which includes a null check before dereferencing.
